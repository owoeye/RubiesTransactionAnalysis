# 💳 Rubies Transaction & Engagement Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **transaction patterns and customer engagement** within the **Rubies Microfinance Bank (MFB)** platform. Despite processing **over ₦2.92 billion** in transactions between **May 2024 and February 2025**, a significant amount of money **leaves the bank** rather than stays. Most users are low-tier and disengaged, indicating poor product utilization.

The goal is to deliver **data-driven insights and strategic recommendations** to:
- Improve **user retention**
- Increase **internal deposits**
- Enhance overall **transaction engagement and profitability**
